The asyncapi field indicates you use the AsyncAPI version 2.5.0.
The info field holds information about the API, such as its name, version, description, and license.
The channels section. This section is used to describe the event names your API will be publishing and/or subscribing to.
In this example, light/measured is the channel name the Streetlight API will subscribe to (i.e, to interact with the Streetlight API you publish to the broker). The operationId property, describes what is the name of function or method that takes care of this functionality in the generated code. The payload property is used to understand how the event should look like when publishing to that channel:
The Payload property defines the content of the event using AsyncAPI schemas. It means that your event payload should contain an id and a lumens property —which are integers bigger than zero—, and a sentAt property that should be a string containing a date and time.
